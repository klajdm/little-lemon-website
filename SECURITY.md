## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your browser updated to the latest version
- Use strong, unique passwords for any accounts
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Sanitize data before displaying to users

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- **Client-Side Validation**: Form validation is implemented on the client-side
- **Data Storage**: No sensitive data is permanently stored in the current version
- **API Calls**: Reservation system uses simulated API calls
- **Authentication**: Login system is for demonstration purposes only

### Recommendations for Production

- Implement server-side validation for all forms
- Use secure authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT)
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add CSRF protection for forms
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular security testing and penetration testing

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- âœ… Input validation on reservation forms
- âœ… XSS prevention through React's built-in protections
- âœ… No direct database queries (simulated API)
- âœ… Responsive design prevents UI-based attacks
- âœ… No sensitive data exposure in client-side code

### Planned Security Enhancements
